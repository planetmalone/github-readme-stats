# GitHub README Stats

This is a fork from https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats. 

There are no changes or customizations. It stays sync'd with the original repo. It was forked because anuraghazra was using their own PAT to support it. In order to alleviate some traffic, I forked the repo (with their permission) and deployed it to my personal Vercel app.

Here is what my card looks like:

<br />

You can test it out by going to [my card](https://github-readme-stats-planetmalone.vercel.app/api?username=planetmalone&count_private=true&hide_title=true&rank_icon=github&show_icons=true&include_all_commits=true&theme=radical) and updating the query parameters to match your needs.

If you like this project, I highly recommend checking out the original repo and forking it.
